# Conclusion

## Reflection on Key Findings
The study concludes that while true free will may remain an illusion, quantum mechanics can contribute to decision-making models that mimic autonomy. This adds depth to AI systems by allowing them to exhibit behavior that appears flexible and self-directed.

## Future Research Directions
Further research is needed to refine quantum-based decision-making models and to investigate how probabilistic reasoning can be applied in fields such as ethics, AI development, and personalized medicine.
