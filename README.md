# Quantum-Based Reasoning: Causality and Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project explores quantum-based reasoning in artificial intelligence, with a focus on causality, decision-making, and the concept of free will. By leveraging principles of quantum mechanics, the study examines the potential of AI to approximate non-deterministic or autonomous reasoning within complex scenarios.

## 1. Introduction
Introduce the goals, scope, and significance of the project. Briefly discuss why quantum mechanics and AI are relevant for exploring complex decision-making and free will.

## 2. Background and Motivation
Provide an overview of existing approaches to decision-making in AI, the limitations of classical models, and how quantum mechanics could offer alternative solutions. Mention related philosophical questions on causality and autonomy.

## 3. Project Objectives
Define the main objectives:
- Investigate quantum mechanics as a foundation for non-deterministic reasoning.
- Explore the role of causality in decision-making processes.
- Examine philosophical implications of free will in AI.

## 4. Philosophical and Theoretical Foundations
Outline key philosophical ideas related to free will, causality, and autonomy. Summarize relevant theories from classical philosophy and introduce the connection to quantum mechanics and AI reasoning.

## 5. Quantum-Based Models of Reasoning
Describe the quantum principles (e.g., superposition, entanglement) used to build reasoning models for AI. Discuss how these principles differ from classical logic and may allow for more complex decision-making simulations.

## 6. Implementation
