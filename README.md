# Quantum-Based Reasoning: Causality and Artificial Intelligence
_Work in Progress_

## Project Overview
This project examines quantum-based reasoning in artificial intelligence, focusing on the integration of causality and decision-making within a deterministic framework. By analyzing the relationship between quantum mechanics and decision models, we explore whether the illusion of free will can be simulated in AI through quantum probabilistic mechanisms.

## Structure and Objectives
The project is structured as follows:

1. **[Introduction](introduction.md)** - Outlines the scope, goals, and relevance of the study.
2. **[Background and Motivation](motivation.md)** - Provides historical and scientific context, linking philosophical ideas to neuroscience and quantum mechanics.
3. **[Key Terms](terms.md)** - Defines foundational concepts like free will, causality, and determinism.
4. **[Theoretical Framework](foundation.md)** - Establishes philosophical and neuroscientific foundations for free will and determinism.
5. **[Quantum-Based Reasoning](reasoning.md)** - Analyzes how quantum mechanics could support decision-making models in AI.
6. **[Case Studies and Scenarios](scenarios.md)** - Presents hypothetical and real-world scenarios illustrating quantum-based decision-making.
7. **[Results and Findings](results.md)** - Summarizes outcomes and assesses whether quantum mechanics contributes to AI decision-making autonomy.
8. **[Conclusion](conclusion.md)** - Reflects on the findings and proposes directions for future research.
