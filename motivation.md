# Background and Motivation

## Historical Perspectives on Free Will and Causality
From Aristotle to Kant, philosophers have long debated the essence of free will and the role of causality. Kant’s dualistic approach—distinguishing between empirical causation and moral autonomy—frames free will as compatible with moral responsibility, though bound by causal chains in the empirical realm.

## Modern Deterministic Perspectives
Contemporary neuroscience suggests that decision-making is heavily influenced by subconscious factors. For instance:
- **Benjamin Libet’s Experiments**: Libet’s work revealed that neural activity precedes conscious decision-making, suggesting that our choices may be predetermined by subconscious processes.
- **Daniel Wegner’s "Illusion of Conscious Will"**: Wegner argued that the experience of free will might be an illusion, shaped by unconscious causation and neurological processes.

## Motivation for a Quantum Perspective
Given the deterministic constraints of classical systems, we explore quantum mechanics as a potential means to simulate "freedom" in decision-making. The inherent randomness in quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, could introduce variability that mimics autonomy.
