## Free Will
Traditionally viewed as the capacity to make choices free from external constraints. This project considers free will as a perceived phenomenon that emerges from complex causal interactions.

## Causality
The principle that every effect has a cause. Kant’s views on causality lay the philosophical groundwork for understanding determinism as a foundational aspect of both natural and human actions.

## Determinism
The theory that all events are determined by preceding causes. Neuroscience supports this view through studies showing how decisions are often made subconsciously, challenging traditional notions of autonomy.

## Quantum Mechanics and Randomness
Quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic events at a fundamental level, which contrasts with classical determinism. In AI, quantum randomness could simulate decision-making processes that appear non-deterministic or “free.”
