# Results and Findings

## Key Insights
Quantum randomness offers a tool to introduce probabilistic elements into AI, creating an illusion of free will within deterministic constraints. This finding supports the hypothesis that quantum mechanics could enrich decision-making models in AI, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

## Limitations and Constraints
The current limitations of quantum technology restrict practical applications, and the philosophical debate on true autonomy remains unresolved. Future improvements in quantum computing may help address these constraints.
