# Introduction

## Overview
The concept of free will has sparked debate across disciplines, particularly in philosophy and neuroscience. While traditional views often advocate for autonomous decision-making, recent advances suggest that our choices may be more determined by causal factors than previously thought. This study explores free will as a possible illusion, examining its implications for artificial intelligence (AI).

## Relevance and Modern Implications
As AI continues to evolve, understanding the nature of decision-making becomes increasingly relevant. Can AI simulate the illusion of free will, and if so, what role might quantum mechanics play in achieving this? This project considers how quantum effects, such as randomness and superposition, might serve as tools to enhance decision-making models within a deterministic framework.

## Objectives
The goal is to evaluate free will as an emergent property of causally determined processes and to investigate if quantum mechanics can provide a model for simulating this phenomenon within AI systems.

## Methodology and Structure
We start by reviewing classical and contemporary views on free will, followed by a discussion of determinism in neuroscience. Finally, we explore quantum mechanics' potential to introduce probabilistic elements to AI decision-making, potentially creating an "illusion" of autonomy.
