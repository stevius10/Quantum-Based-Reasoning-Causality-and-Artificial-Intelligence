# Theoretical Framework

## Philosophical Foundations

### Immanuel Kant on Causality and Autonomy
Kant proposed that while the physical world operates under deterministic laws, humans possess autonomy within a moral realm. This concept allows for a view of free will that is compatible with causality, though Kant’s approach is more focused on moral responsibility than empirical science.

### David Hume’s Compatibilism
Hume argued that desires and actions are causally determined yet aligned with a sense of freedom, as long as choices reflect personal desires without external coercion. His perspective serves as a bridge between free will and determinism, which can inform discussions on AI behavior.

## Neuroscientific Foundations

### Benjamin Libet’s Findings
Libet’s experiments demonstrated that neural activity, indicating a decision, occurs milliseconds before the individual becomes consciously aware of the choice. This challenges the notion of free will by suggesting that unconscious brain processes govern actions before conscious awareness.

### Daniel Wegner’s Theory on Illusory Free Will
Wegner proposed that free will may be an illusion created by the brain’s causal mechanisms. This idea supports the deterministic view, suggesting that while individuals experience free will, their actions are predetermined by complex neural and environmental factors.
